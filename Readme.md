Twenty-four ants are placed randomly on a meter-long rod; each ant
is facing east or west with equal probability. At a signal, they proceed
to march forward (that is, in whatever direction they are facing) at 1
cm/sec; whenever two ants collide, they reverse directions. How long
does it take before you can be certain that all the ants are off the rod?
